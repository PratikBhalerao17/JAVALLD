Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.

Categories of Design Patterns :

Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
Structural Patterns: Concerned with object composition and how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.
Behavioral Patterns: Focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate together.
